# Analyzing Violent Crime Statistics in TorontoNeighbourhoods

## Overview

The City of Toronto has made crime statistics for each of its neighbourhoods publicly available through it's Open Data Program. This data will be analyzed to observe how violent crime rates are distributed amongst the neighbourhoods of the city. A trend has been observed where a small number of neighbourhoods exhibit a larger crime rate than the majority of other neighbourhoods. However, these distributions vary from crime to crime.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
